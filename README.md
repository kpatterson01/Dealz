The objective of our project is to locate restaurant deals for people. Everyone loves food but sometimes people can not get the food that they want at restaurants because it is too expensive. However, a lot of people do not know about the vast amount of deals restaurants offer to their customers. This app will allow customers to see all of the deals a restaurant will offer allowing them to select the best food they want to eat.
